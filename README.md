# Project: Degen Token (ERC-20): Unlocking the Future of Gaming

Smart contract to create an ERC20 Token on the Avalanche test network.

## Description

This is an ERC20 token on the Avalanche network for Degen Gaming. The smart contract has the following functionality:

- Minting new tokens: The platform is able to create new tokens and distribute them to players as rewards. Only the owner can mint tokens.
- Transferring tokens: Players are able to transfer their tokens to others.
- Redeeming tokens: Players are able to redeem their tokens for items in the in-game store.
- Checking token balance: Players are able to check their token balance at any time.
- Burning tokens: Anyone is able to burn tokens, that they own, that are no longer needed.
- An in-game store: A store that has the functionalty of a marketplace which stores the name and the price of products.

## Getting Started

### Installing

- Fork the repository and run `npm i`.
- Create a file called ".env" and add your Private key and API key as per the variables in the hardhat.config file

### Executing program

- Copy the code and paste it in Remix IDE
- Compile the contract
- Deploy the contract
- Use the function mint to mint the token to a particular address
- Other user can burn or redeem their tokens
- The owner can add new items to the shop

## Help

There is no function to view the items in the shop. This is to minimize the gas fees. As the project would scale the gas required to perform every transaction would also increase.
